## "What's in this repository?"

This repository contains a colletion of materials for a course on digital literacy in higher education developed as part of the DiLER project of the Goethe-University Frankfurt.

DiLER or Digital Literacy for Empirical Research  aims to provide an Open Educational Resource using multimodal competence-oriented content and examination, where the overall goal is to create a framework for providing, bundling, and introducing the benefits of cost-free, open resources for promoting research-based learning in higher eductaion, with a focus on the core competency of "digital literacy" in the empirical sciences.

This course allthough limited in scope will aim to demonstrate how such a course centered around digital literacy may look like.
