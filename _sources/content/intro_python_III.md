# Intro Python III

Within the seventh session we'll continue to explore the basic building blocks of `python`, this and the next `session` will contain exhaustive content aiming to provide you with a somewhat detailed understanding of central `python` aspects. The aim is to get a good set of basic experience to then advance into more practical aspects, specifically evaluating how these things can be utilized within `experiments` to collect data and their subsequent `analyzes`. To nevertheless get some experience on the way, there will be some exercise at the beginning and throughout the session. Additionally, the `homework assignments` will be made in a way that showcases some tasks that you might most likely encounter in real-life so that you get more practice in conducting them through `python`.

## Topics 💡👨🏻‍🏫 

In the following you'll find the `objectives` and `materials` for each of the topics we'll discuss during this session.


### Introduction to Python - II
This session, we'll build upon the things learned last week and broader our capabilities in `python`, focusing on `indentation` and `control flow & structures`. 

#### Objectives 📍

- learn about `indentation` (some form of `code structuring`)
- `control` how our `code` is `executed`
  - `Conditionals` (`if` - `else` `statements`)
  - `Iteration` (e.g., `for-loops`, `while statements`, …)
- Ask and answer questions
- Have a great time

#### Materials 📓

Please see the rendered version of the `jupyter notebook` [Introduction VII - Introduction to Python III](https://m-earnest.github.io/Python_for_Psychologists_Winter2022/introduction/introduction_7.html) in the `ToC` on the left.

### Prepare PsychoPy installation

Also, in preparation for our switch to more applied things, i.e. starting with experiments in `python`. We'll have to install `psychopy`. To do that please download the programm from [here](https://www.psychopy.org/download.html) and follow the instructions for your specific operating system. If you encounter any Problems, please let me know!


### Homework assignment #5
Your fifth homework assignment will entail working through a few tasks covering the contents discussed in this session within a `jupyter notebook`. You can download it [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HACo0XwC04Tef3zP_2471K1JMvwzeb3Y/view?usp=share_link). In order to open it, put the `homework assignment notebook` within the folder you stored the `course materials` in, start a `jupyter notebook server` as during the sessions, navigate to the `homework assignment notebook`, open it and have fun! NB: a substantial part of it will be optional and thus the notebook will look way longer than it actually is.

**Deadline: 15/01/2023, 11:59 PM EST**
