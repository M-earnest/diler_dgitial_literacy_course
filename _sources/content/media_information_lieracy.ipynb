    "Information & media literacy refers to the ability to access, evaluate, and use information and media in a critical and responsible manner. It involves understanding how information is produced, distributed, and consumed, and being able to identify credible sources and assess the quality of information. In today's digital age, where information is easily accessible and widely available, it's crucial for individuals to have strong information and media literacy skills to navigate the vast amount of information and media available. This knowledge will not only help you make informed decisions but also help you effectively participate in society. In this course, we will explore the fundamental concepts and skills of information & media literacy, helping you become a more informed and discerning consumer of information and media.\n",
