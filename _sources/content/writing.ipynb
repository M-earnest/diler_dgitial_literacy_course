    "\n",
    "-------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Focus your paper on a central contribution, which you communicate in the title\n",
    "\n",
    "A paper ideally aims to provide a single contribution, multiple contributions tend to be less convincing, therefore less memorable. The title is here a crucial part, as it's the first element a reader encounters and determines if people will read even the abstract. Focus on a single message, transmitted by the title, but don't over-sell.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "-------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Write for flesh-and-blood human beings who do not know your work\n",
    "\n",
    "You as the writer will be the expert on your work, but we'll have to assume that reader's may possibly be naive to the work or field. Therefore we need to consider the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - quality and how clear your writing is can be nearly impossible to judge work from perspective of naive reader\n",
    "\n",
    "    - an approach from the perspective of naive reader means to make clear \"why do you need to understand/care about this problem\" and how the paper answers the problem/question (ideally understandable with minimal effort).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - define technical terms and avoid abbreviations/acronyms \n",
    "        - adapt to working memory constraints of humans\n",
    "        - 2-3 abbreviations in total, write out first time with abbreviation in ()\n",
    "        - avoid using different words for same concept/thing -> confuses the reader\n",
    "\n",
    "---------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Stick to the context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme \n",
    "\n",
    "Scientific papers benefit from being written in a classical story structure with a discernible beginning, a well-defined body, and an conclusive end. Therefore we make use of the context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The C-C-C scheme defines the structure of the paper on multiple scales:\n",
    "\n",
    "`for the whole paper:`\n",
    "\n",
    "        - introduction = context\n",
    "        - methods/results = body\n",
    "        - discussion =  conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "`for each paragraph:`\n",
    "\n",
    "        - first sentence = defines the topic or context\n",
    "        - body = novel content put forth for the reader’s consideration\n",
    "        - last sentence = provides the conclusion to be remembered\n",
    "\n",
    "The C-C-C scheme produces texts aimed at more patient readers, that take their time to engage and interact with a text.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's best to generally avoid writing for impatient readers. We'll have to rely on the title and abstract for this, but these can be caught via presenting the most exciting content first, while neccesarily following up with important context to remain credible.\n",

    "### 4. Optimize your logical flow by avoiding zig-zag and using parallelism\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid zig-zag through your story:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - only the central idea should be touched upon multiple times\n",
    "    - minimize number of subject changes\n",

    "\n",
    "Sometimes it becomes neccessary to have complete control over the look of a document, sometimes ceratin journals will ask to provide manuscripts via a `.tex` file. \n",
    "\n",
    "Both involve knowledge of [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) (pronounced \"Lah-tech\").\n",
    "\n",
    "LaTeX is a powerful and flexible typesetting language that allows users to have complete control over the format of a document. Unlike traditional word processors, which can often be limiting in terms of formatting options, LaTeX provides the ability to create beautiful and professional-looking documents with ease. This is particularly useful for academic papers, where formatting requirements can be strict and complex. However, LaTeX is not just limited to academic papers, it can also be used to create CVs, resumes, and other types of documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "LaTeX is at times still the preferred tool for many publishers and academic institutions. Additionally, because LaTeX allows for such fine-grained control over formatting, it can help to ensure that papers meet specific style requirements for different publications.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, learning LaTeX from the ground up can be time-consuming and challenging, which is why platforms like Overleaf are becoming increasingly popular.\n",

    "### Overleaf\n",
    "\n",
    "Overleaf is a powerful collaborative platform designed to simplify the process of creating and sharing academic documents. It offers a range of tools and features that make it easy for individuals and teams to write, edit, and collaborate on documents in real-time. With Overleaf, you can focus on the content of your document while the platform takes care of formatting and layout.\n",

    "One of the main benefits of Overleaf is its ability to streamline the writing process, allowing you to work more efficiently and effectively. The platform offers a wide range of templates and tools that help you create high-quality documents quickly and easily. There are templates available for a wide range of document types, including academic papers, CVs, and resumes, as well as a variety of styles and formats to choose from. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, Overleaf provides a range of collaboration tools that allow users to work together on a document in real-time, making it easy to share feedback and ideas and provides a secure and reliable platform for sharing and publishing your work. With built-in version control and easy integration with a range of popular publishing platforms, you can be confident that your work is safe and accessible to others.\n",

Some templates, like the one depicted here, already come with user guides that you can simply follow to adapt a template to your needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main content of a document on overleaf is contained in `.tex` files. These LaTeX files contain both the text content you'll see in the rendered view, as well as the LaTeX code specifiying how the text should be displayed.\n",
    "LaTex code will be displayed in `green` and the text a it modifies is included in curly braces `{}` behind. For example the `\\section{Introduction}` declares that we'd like to start a new section with the title `\"Introduction\"`.\n",
