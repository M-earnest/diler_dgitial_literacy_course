    "Due to the evolution of computers and increasingly faster communication technologies science has evolved beyond simply collecting data for a specific project, running some (simple) analysis and publishing results in a scientific journal. Buzzwords like \"Big Data\", \"cloud computing\" and Machine learning/A.I have taken the world, Academia included, by storm. In the following lesson we'll provide a general introduction regarding relevant concepts and technlogogies, how and when to apply them and guide you towards additional ressources that may help you evolve these skillsets yourself.\n",
