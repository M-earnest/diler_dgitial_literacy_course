    "### Jupyter Books\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Books provides a flexible and powerful platform for creating, publishing, and sharing your work. Creating content using Jupyter Books is a simple process that allows you to combine text, code, and other multimedia elements into a single, interactive document. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a TlDR guide on how to create content using Jupyter Books:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Install Jupyter Books**: On macOS and Linux this is relatively straightforward by opening a terminal and inputing the command \n",
    "\n",
    "`pip install jupyter-book`\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add windows explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Create a new book**: Creating a new book is as simple as running the command \"jupyter-book create mybook\", where \"mybook\" should be replaced with the name of your book.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Content creation\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating content for your book is very straightforward. Using e.g. the text-editor VsCode that we've installed in the [setup](), you can create a jupyter notebook (.ipynb) or markdown (.md) file. A tutorial on how to create \n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Add content**: You can add content to your book by creating markdown files and Jupyter notebooks. To create a markdown file, you can use any text editor and save the file with a \".md\" extension. To create a Jupyter notebook, you can use the Jupyter interface and save the file with a \".ipynb\" extension.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Link and structure content**: To link the different components of your book together, you'll need to create a table of contents file in the markdown format. The file specifies the order of your chapters and sections, as well as the links to the corresponding markdown and Jupyter notebook files. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Table of contents files\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of a table of contents (TOC) file for a Jupyter book depends on the organization of your book and the chapters and sections that you want to include. The structure of the TOC file defines the organization and order of the pages in your Jupyter book.\n",
    "\n",
    "A basic structure for a TOC file in a Jupyter book would include the following elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Title: The title of your book.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Introduction: A section that provides an overview of the purpose and content of your book.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Chapters: Each chapter in your book should be listed as a separate item in the TOC file, and each chapter should include a title and a list of sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Sections: Each section in your book should be listed as a separate item within the relevant chapter in the TOC file, and each section should include a title and a file reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of a simple TOC file for a Jupyter book:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "title: My Jupyter Book\n",
    "\n",
    "introduction:\n",
    "  - file: intro.ipynb\n",
    "  - title: Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "chapters:\n",
    "  - title: Chapter 1\n",
    "    sections:\n",
    "      - title: Section 1.1\n",
    "        file: chapter_1/section_1.1.ipynb\n",
    "      - title: Section 1.2\n",
    "        file: chapter_1/section_1.2.ipynb\n",
    "\n",
    "  - title: Chapter 2\n",
    "    sections:\n",
    "      - title: Section 2.1\n",
    "        file: chapter_2/section_2.1.ipynb\n",
    "      - title: Section 2.2\n",
    "        file: chapter_2/section_2.2.ipynb\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the book has two chapters, each with two sections. The title and file reference for each section is specified, and the order of the chapters and sections is defined by the order in which they are listed in the TOC file. The TOC file should be saved with the filename toc.yml in the root directory of your Jupyter book.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Build the book**: To build your book open a terminal and run the command \"jupyter-book build mybook\". Replace \"mybook\" with the name of your book. This will compile all of your content into a single, interactive document that can be viewed in a web browser. The newly created files will be stored in a new folder called \"\\_build\", contained you'll find another falled called \"html\", click on any of the herein contained .html files to open your book in your webbrowser\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Publish the book**: Finally, you can publish your book online by using a service such as GitHub Pages, which will be explained in the following section-\n",

    "You simply create a repository in GitHub and push your website files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) to the repository. GitHub Pages then automatically generates the website and makes it available at a unique URL. This URL is typically in the format \"username.github.io/repository-name\".\n",
