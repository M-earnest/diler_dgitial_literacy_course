# Jupyter Notebooks

Within the fourth session we'll finish the `virtualization` section, that is exploring one aspect that might seem adjacent to utilizing `python` within research workflows but is actually a crucial component: `computing environments`. Don't worry: this will also entail hands-on programming, just not directly in `python`. The things covered in this section will introduce central concepts for our subsequent endeavors in this session. More precisely, we'll explore `jupyter notebooks` as one form of interacting with your computer, specifically `python`. Getting a good hang of this will be important as most of our `python` endeavors will happen within `jupyter notebooks` and they are a staple in research workflows.

## Topics 💡👨🏻‍🏫 

In the following you'll find the `objectives` and `materials` for each of the topics we'll discuss during this session.


### Jupyter notebooks
During the previous session we had a look at different ways of communicating with our computers. Generally speaking we could either use a `GUI` or a `CLI`. In more detail we also have different options to utilize the same `programming language` to communicate with our `computer`, e.g. the `shell`, `jupyter notebooks` and `IDE`s. After we already explored the `shell` a bit, we'll now spend a closer look at `jupyter notebook` and how we can work with them. This is a central topic as the `python introduction` and `data analyzes` parts of the course will be conducted via `jupyter notebook` and you'll have to hand in most assignments via them as well.  

#### Objectives 📍

- learn basic and efficient usage of the jupyter ecosystem & notebooks
    - what is Jupyter & how to utilize jupyter notebooks
- Ask and answer questions
- Have a great time

#### Materials 📓
