    "## What is \"digital literacy\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "A straightforward definition of digital literacy usually pertains to ones ability to independently find, evaluate, communicate, and handle information from digital media (Shopova 2014).\n",
    "\n",
    "That the lack of digital literacy can limit social integration and personal growth, making it a crucial life skill to possess (Shapiro, 2009) was already true more than a decade ago, nowadays as more and more of our everyday life drifts into virtual spaces it becomes an absolute necessity to be digital literate. This is especially true for people in academdia and research, as every step of our acadmic carreer and every step in the research process nowadays is dependent on finding, evaluating and applying knowledge found online or dependent in the application of digital tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "The importance of digital literacy is not to be underestimated as digital literacy in itself may be viewed simply as  the current form of \"literacy per se\" in our culture - i.e. \"to read, write and otherwise deal with information using the technologies and formats of the time\". (Bawden, 2008)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore the idea behind this ability a bit more closely. There's been quite a few different understandings what it means to be digital literacy over the last decades, each including their own definition and correlated implications (Bawden, 2008). The discourse can roughly be categorized into two positions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Where one position holds the idea that digital literacy is primarily concerned with a set of skills, that have to be aquired to be seen a as digitally literate, while the other holds the idea that digital literacy is focused on the \"cognitive and socio-emotional aspects of working in a digital environment\"\n",
    "\n",
    "For this course we're not only leaning into the idea of digital literacy as a competence or a generalizable ability, following the initial proposition of \"mastering ideas, not keystrokes\" by Paul Glister (1997), but we will demonstrate the underlying concepts, such as how to \"find or handle information\", by discussing specfific tools and how to properly use them. Therefore demonstrating how these concepts relate to the aquisition and possibly mastery of a skillset, that will make scientific work much easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As this course is primarily centered around scientific practice, we will not be dealing with basic topics such as \"What is this interenet?\", \"what's a meme?\" or \"how do i use social media?\". \n",
    "Although we can make a point of them, as they illustrate the basic point of why digital literacy is such an important concept, namely that there is  “participation gap”, between those who can and can't maneuver digital spaces and handle digital information. \n",
    "\n",
    "The \"participation gap\" this course tries to bridge is based on the differences between those that can effectively use digital tools and information to do scientific work and those who may not have the necessary knowledge yet.\n",

In short, being digitally literate is essential for everonye involved in this system.\n",
